# Kibana
This is a attempt to support kibana 3 as I find it nice and easier to work with than kibana 4.

Therefore I will make it work with aggregation framework instead of facets so it will work against Elasticsearch 2
Following panels are currently working:
terms,
histogram,
table,

I am going to try to add missing panels:
- histograms that are not time based,
- data table as in Kibana 4,
- maybe more
