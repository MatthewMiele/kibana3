# Kibana
This is an attempt to support Kibana 3 as I find it nice and easier to work with than Kibana 4.

Therefore I will make it work with aggregation framework instead of facets so it will work against Elasticsearch 2.

Following panels are already done and working:
- terms,
- histogram,
- table


I am going to try to add missing panels:
- histograms that are not time based,
- data table as in Kibana 4,
